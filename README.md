Just requires vimplug. See vimplug github page for installation instructions (should be as simple as adding the vimplug file to the autoload folder). 

Sometimes when themes are installed, they are not installed in ~/.vim/colors but in ~/.vim/plugged/<themename>/colors. May need to manually mv the folder into the colors directory
